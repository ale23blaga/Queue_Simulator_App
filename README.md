# Queue Simulator App

## Overview
The **Queue Simulation App** is a Java-based application that allows users to simulate a real-life queue sistem and view the eveolution of it's state, as wells as statistics.

## Feautures
- Set the queue parameters (numbers of tasks, servers, the start and end time, etc.)
- View the evolution of the Simulation
- See the statistics at the end of the Simulation
## Technologies used
- **Porgraming Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maeven
- **GUI Library:** Swing
- **Version Control:** Git


## User Guide
1. Lauch the application
2. Set the parameters for the queue Simulation
3. Press start
4. Observe the animation and the logs for the real time Simulation
5. Export the logs from the auto generated logFile.txt
6. Close the application
7. Start from 1. if you want to repeat
